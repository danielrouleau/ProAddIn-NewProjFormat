# Sample ArcGIS Pro Add-In with new Project System
This is a sample ArcGIS Pro Add-In project using the "new" csproj system. 

This sample is largely derived from the work in https://github.com/aienabled/WpfNewProjectSystemSample as a starting point, adding the necessary tooling required for ArcGIS Pro.

### Caveats
- Pro SDK templates do not work with this project structure
- Items marked as AddInContent do not show as such in IDE, and must be edited in csproj directly
